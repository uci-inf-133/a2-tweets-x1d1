3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list sites like StackOverflow or specific URLs for tutorials; describe queries to Generative AI or use of AI-based code completion)
- StackOverflow, w3schools
    - Documentation and help regarding certain html element attributes and classes that I was accessing through DOM with JavaScript
    - I did not save the exact URLs
- Vega-Lite Documentation
    - https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/
